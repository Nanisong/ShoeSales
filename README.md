# ShoeSales Web API and App
ShoeSales is a straightforward e-commerce platform focused on shoes. It follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern, ensuring a well-organized and maintainable codebase. The project consists of two main components: the **ShoeSales Web API** (backend) and the **ShoeSales App** (frontend). While the app remains minimalistic, the Web API showcases essential **CRUD operations** and **MongoDB** integration.

## Key Features
### 1. Real CRUD Operations
The ShoeSales Web API provides endpoints for full CRUD functionality:
- Create: Add new shoe products to the database.
- Read: Retrieve product details, including availability, price, brand, and name.
- Update: Modify existing product information (e.g., price adjustments, stock updates).
- Delete: Remove products from the inventory.
  
### 2. MongoDB Integration 
ShoeSales breaks away from data seeding by connecting directly to a **MongoDB database**.
This real-time interaction ensures that your app reflects the actual state of the shoe inventory.

### 3. Minimalistic App
The ShoeSales App serves as a simple interface for users to:
View available shoe products.
Log in securely.
